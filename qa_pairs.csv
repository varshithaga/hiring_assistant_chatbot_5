8dcc6aa3-3129-42a1-8066-8db310ebb638,"**Data Handling & Frameworks:**  ""Describe a scenario where you'd choose a NoSQL database over SQL, and explain your reasoning, including potential framework choices (e.g., Django/Flask with MongoDB vs. Django/Flask with PostgreSQL)."" (Assesses database knowledge, framework understanding, and practical decision-making)","I’d choose a NoSQL database like MongoDB over SQL (PostgreSQL) in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured, like in a social media app with dynamic post content (text, images, comments). MongoDB’s flexible document model and horizontal scalability make it easier to handle this type of data and high user activity.

For frameworks, I’d use Flask with MongoDB (via Flask-PyMongo) for rapid prototyping and lightweight handling of JSON-like data. Django with PostgreSQL would be better suited for structured, relational data (like e-commerce with consistent fields). In short, NoSQL is ideal when data flexibility and horizontal scaling are critical."
8dcc6aa3-3129-42a1-8066-8db310ebb638,"**API Interaction & Debugging:** ""You're using Postman to test a REST API built with Flask (or Django REST framework). You receive a 500 Internal Server Error. Describe your debugging process, including tools and techniques you'd use to pinpoint the problem."" (Assesses API testing skills, debugging abilities, and framework familiarity)","If I get a 500 Internal Server Error when testing an API in Postman, I’d:

- Check the response body in Postman for error details.
- Check server logs (Flask console or Django runserver output).
-Enable debug mode (Flask’s debug=True or Django’s DEBUG=True).
- Validate request data (e.g., JSON syntax, required fields).
- Use debuggers like pdb to inspect code at runtime.
- If needed, update Postman request (method, headers, body)."
8dcc6aa3-3129-42a1-8066-8db310ebb638,"**Concurrency & Efficiency (Java/Python):** ""Explain the difference between a thread and a process in Java (or Python). Describe a situation where using multithreading (or multiprocessing) would improve the performance of an application, and briefly outline how you'd implement it.""  (Assesses fundamental concurrency concepts and their practical application in different languages)","Thread vs. Process:
Threads share memory within a process; processes are independent.

Use case:
Use multithreading for network-bound tasks (like downloading files) to speed up I/O operations. In Python, I’d use the threading module; in Java, ExecutorService for managing threads."
8dcc6aa3-3129-42a1-8066-8db310ebb638,"**Frontend & Version Control:** ""You're building a React component that fetches data from a Django/Flask backend API.

Customers: customer_id (PK), name, email

Orders: order_id (PK), customer_id (FK), order_date

OrderItems: order_item_id (PK), order_id (FK), product_id (FK), quantity

Explanation:
Primary keys uniquely identify records. Foreign keys link orders to customers and order items to both orders and products, ensuring data integrity and enabling normalized design."
ff94dc03-ed63-44a8-aab0-ac57e94cf5b2,"**MongoDB/NoSQL:**  ""Compare and contrast MongoDB and SQL databases.  When would you choose one over the other, and what are the trade-offs?"" (Assesses understanding of NoSQL databases, their strengths and weaknesses compared to relational databases, and the ability to choose the right tool for the job.)","**MongoDB vs. SQL:**
MongoDB is schema-flexible, stores data as JSON-like documents, and scales horizontally. SQL databases have fixed schemas, use tables with relations, and provide strong ACID transactions.

**When to choose:**
Use MongoDB for unstructured or rapidly changing data, like content management or IoT. Use SQL for structured data with complex relationships, like financial or inventory systems.

**Trade-offs:**
MongoDB sacrifices some consistency for flexibility and scalability, while SQL ensures data integrity but can be less flexible and harder to scale horizontally.
